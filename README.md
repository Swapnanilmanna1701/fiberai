## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Access to a [Firebase Project](https://firebase.google.com/)

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

First, you need to configure your Firebase project credentials.

1.  Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file named `.env`.
2.  Log in to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
3.  Navigate to **Project Settings** > **General**.
4.  Under "Your apps", find your web app and click the **</>** icon to view its configuration.
5.  Copy the values from the `firebaseConfig` object and paste them into your `.env` file.

Your `.env` file should look like this:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_ID
```

You will also need to provide a Google AI API key for the generative features.

```bash
# Obtain your key from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Populate the Database

To use the application, you need to seed your Firestore database with the provided company data. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

This will connect to your Firebase project and upload all the company data from `src/lib/data.ts`.

### 4. Run the Development Servers

This project requires two development servers running concurrently:

1.  **Next.js App Server:** Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the main web application, typically on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **Genkit AI Server:** Open a second terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This starts the Genkit server that powers the AI features.

Once both servers are running, you can access the application in your browser.
